this is chapter 3
now suppose if we change the content on chapter and we want to get it back as we save this file we can't find the pervious content so to find the content as we add git in the folder so we can find this using git diff chapter3.txt
then it will show the previous saved and newly saved content.
And using git checkout chapter3.txt we can rollback to the previous content.
